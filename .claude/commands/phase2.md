Read CLAUDE.md, docs/phase2-aws.md, and MEMORY.md for current project state.

All Phase 1 validation queries (docs/validation-queries.md) must pass before starting Phase 2.

Then start Phase 2-1: Containerise — Dockerfile multi-stage build, verify locally with docker compose.

Ask before making any assumptions not covered in CLAUDE.md or docs/phase2-aws.md.
