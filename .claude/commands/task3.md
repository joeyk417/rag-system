Read CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md for current project state, then start Task 3: Ingestion pipeline.

Implement in order: pdf_extractor → metadata_parser → chunker → embedder → dedup → pipeline.py → POST /ingest + GET /ingest/{job_id}.

Read reference_notebooks/01 (PageRAG - Data Ingestion) before implementing each module.

Ask before making any assumptions not covered in CLAUDE.md.
