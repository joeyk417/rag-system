Read CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md for current project state, then start Task 4: Retrieval pipeline.

Implement in order: filter_extractor → keyword_generator → vector_store → bm25_ranker → retriever.py.

Read reference_notebooks/02 (Data Retrieval and ReRanking) before implementing each module.

Ask before making any assumptions not covered in CLAUDE.md.
