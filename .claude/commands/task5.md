Read CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md for current project state, then start Task 5: CRAG agent.

Implement in order: state.py → nodes.py (retrieve, grade, rewrite, web_search, generate) → crag_agent.py LangGraph graph.

Read reference_notebooks/04 (Corrective RAG) before implementing.

Ask before making any assumptions not covered in CLAUDE.md.
