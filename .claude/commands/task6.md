Read CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md for current project state, then start Task 6: Chat API + remaining endpoints + tests.

Implement: POST /chat, GET /documents, DELETE /documents/{id}, admin endpoints (POST/GET/PATCH /admin/tenants), get_tenant/get_admin dependencies in app/dependencies.py, unit + integration tests, run all validation queries from docs/validation-queries.md.

Ask before making any assumptions not covered in CLAUDE.md.
